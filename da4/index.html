    <h2><b>Royal Ambush</b></h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    What is original about your game?
    </li>
    <p>The rules of the games are based on an original analogue prototype (described in the short attached document). 
        Only the first phase of those rules are implemented in this prototype.
        It is also a 2 player game, requiring players to share the mouse and trade and their turn comes around. 
    </p>

    <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    What is interesting about your game technology?
    </li>
    <p>Hex coordinate system, sleek animations and transitions, responsive kinaesthetic, 
        tile generation and population (could be randomized if the ruleset required to it).
        dynamic tile-based user functionality, abstract proximity detection. Figuring out how to generate and interact with hex board
        was actually extremely involved for me, with a lot of manual calculations to make sense of hexagonal x,y,z and relative positioning and logic.
        Much of my effort was to make a solid foundation of code for any type of game that uses a regular hexagonal tile system -- not just this simple demonstration. 
    </p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    What did you learn from this prototype?
    What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    </li>
    <p>Learning the principle design patterns in games the hard way. Thinks like phase loops and control pass-offs between different components.
        Encapsulating logic and learning the best practices was a big challenge as well. I really tried and immerse myself in learning the "right"
        way to code a game, rather than taking a bunch of shortcuts and making a one-off demo in a comfy, but non-expandable way. I look forward to
        implementing the "battle" phase when I get the chance to improve on this prototype. Then we can have an actual win condition and a proper closed loop.
    </p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    </li>
    <p>I made all of my graphical assets, using generic Photoshop assets and hand-drawings.<br>
    Audio assets are used under Creative Commons by "<a href="https://otologic.jp/free/license.html">OtoLogic</a>"</p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    </li>
    <p>Really all the code is completely from scratch. It is written in typescript -- and I extended the classes which made most sense to me,
        as a new dev in Phaser. Technically you could say I started with the minimal template, but rewrote everything.</p>

    <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    </li>
    <p>Fun modern twist on ancient traditional board game 'Tafl'</p>

    <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    </li><p>Challenge: Must be played with someone else/Things are only added, not removed. (Concept was targeting DA 1 challenges but carried over due to delays.)</p>

    <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    </li><p>Input: Mouse, clickable buttons; Randomness: little-to-none; Play-style: Competitor, craftsmen, storyteller; Genre: board game </p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    </li><p>The goals really revolved around demonstrating: two players being able to interact with the same objects on a screen, in a controlled fashion with expected inputs being guided.
        Visually and logically transferring control among the players and the game loop; interactive hexagonal tile system based on 2.5d x,y,z coordinates.
        THe "look" and "feel" of a feature-complete game that fully implements the board game rules.</p>

    <p><b><u>The following are described in more detail in the labeled sections of the attached doc.</u></b></p>
    <li><strong>Player Experience Goals</strong>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Gameplay</strong>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Strategies</strong>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise</strong>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Target Audience</strong>
    Competitive people of all ages, or even those just looking to have a casual battle of wits against their friends. The rules are really simple enough
    to be accessable to really anyone, though maybe a little too calm and strategic for those you are into skill based games.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    Each round is very short, less than 2 mins. After fully implementing the second phase, the rounds should be more like 5 mins.
