    <h2><b>Royal Ambush</b></h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Note: This is the completed version of DA2</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    What is original about your game?
    </li>
    <p>While looking like a familiar board game, <i>Royal Ambush</i> is an original modern take on an ancient Celtic/Nordic game called '<i>Tafl</i>'.<br>
        Requiring two players sharing the same mouse and screen -- emulating a real-life board -- this game implements an original set of rules which I hand-crafted to suit the unique dynamics of a hex board.<br>
        It calls to mind a unique blend of "Go" and "Checkers", but with a asymmetrical rule-set and objectives between "Ambushers" and "Royalty" players.<br>
        There is also an element of chance, in that the first player's turn to kick off <i>Battle Phase</i> is always randomly chosen, shaking things up from a traditional chess-like game.
        Given the asymmetry, players can have entirely different gameplay experiences depending on which side they play. But ultimately, this is a game that is extremely intuitive, quick-to-learn-yet-hard-to-master, high velocity, and intellectually engaging.<br>
        Also, there is a light bit of flavor-narrative behind the setting of the game - described in the concept doc below - though this prototype does not embellish on that directly, though artistic choices were made to suit it.  
    </p>

    <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    What is interesting about your game technology?
    </li>
    <p>A lot of this game is a mini tech-demo for myself, teaching myself and playing around with things like x,y,z hex coordinate system, focused aesthetics, sleek animations and transitions, responsive and intuitive kinaesthetic, 
        tile generation and population, complex fully event-based logic (the scene computes <i>nothing</i> directly per frame/update, all logic is handled through Phaser 3 scene-level event and tween managers),
        dynamic user functionality, abstract hit detection and direction system (suiting hexagon concept: NE,E,SE,SW,W,NW), user-friendliness, audio feedback and dynamic audio selection (alternating sfx, variation).</br>
        Figuring out how to generate and interact with hex board was actually extremely involved for me, with a lot of manual calculations and staring at unit circles and triangles to make sense of hexagonal x,y,z and relative positioning and logic. 
    </p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    What did you learn from this prototype?
    What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    </li>
    <p>Learning the principle design patterns in games the hard way. Thinks like phase loops and control pass-offs between different components.
        Encapsulating logic and learning the best practices was a big challenge as well. I really tried and immerse myself in learning the "right"
        way to code a game. Event based logic is definitely new for me, and reaching more that <i>a thousand lines of code</i> is a testament to how involved the state-keeping and event-loops turned out to be, haha.   
    </p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    </li>
    <p>I made all of my graphical assets, using generic Photoshop assets and hand-drawings.<br>
    Audio assets are used under Creative Commons from <a href="https://otologic.jp/free/license.html">OtoLogic</a></p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    </li>
    <p>Really all the code is completely from scratch. It is written in typescript -- and I extended the classes which made most sense to me,
        as a new dev in Phaser. Technically you could say I started with the minimal template, but rewrote everything.</p>

    <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    </li>
    <p>Fun modern twist on ancient traditional board game 'Tafl'</p>

    <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    </li><p>Challenge: Must be played with someone else/Things are only added, not removed. (Concept was targeting DA 1 challenges but carried over due to delays.)</p>

    <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    </li><p>Input: Mouse, clickable buttons; Randomness: little-to-none; Play-style: Competitor, craftsmen, storyteller; Genre: board game </p>

    <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    </li><p>The goals really revolved around demonstrating: two players being able to interact with the same objects on a screen, in a controlled fashion with expected inputs being guided.
        Visually and logically transferring control among the players and the game loop; interactive hexagonal tile system based on 2.5d x,y,z coordinates.
        THe "look" and "feel" of a feature-complete game that fully implements the board game rules. Finally to test the balance and envisioned rule-set of game.

    <p><b><u>The following are described in more detail in the labeled sections of the attached doc.</u></b></p>
    <li><strong>Player Experience Goals</strong>

    <li><strong>Strategies</strong>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise</strong>
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Target Audience</strong>
    Competitive people of all ages, or even those just looking to have a casual battle of wits against their friends. The rules are really simple enough
    to be accessable to really anyone, though maybe a little too calm and strategic for those you are into skill based games. However, being a hex board makes the style of thinking more multi-lateral as compared to traditional board games.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    Each round is very short, taking less than 5 mins. Players may play with score being kept on the left until they meet their own score criteria.
