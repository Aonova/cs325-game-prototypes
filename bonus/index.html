        <p>[W][A][S][D] to fire thrusters in respective direction.<br>[R] to increase thrust<br>[F] to decrease thrust.<br>[X] to reset thrust to gravity level.<br><br><b>Note:</b> re-spawning is currently buggy, so I disabled it for this demo. Reload the page to try again.
        </p></li>
    <li><h3>Originality:</h3>
        <p>Unique blend of physics simulation and side-scroller skill-based game: play as the remote flight controller for Theta-315, an engineer mech unit dispatched to gather data on an anomalous black hole spawned from the catastrophic meltdown of the fusion core of an advanced orbiting base. Fight fluctuating gravity and avoid dangerous plasma fragments to gather as much data as possible in orbit without losing your mech to the black hole. A unique side-scrolling setup mixing random gravity and quick reactions, as well as accurate spaceflight dynamics using thruster pulses. 
        </p></li>
    <li><h3>Technical Merit:</h3>
        <p>Responsive design and animations, hand-drawn and cohesive graphics, infinite paralax background system, functional and balanced audio, tuned and mixed for consistent volume and player auditory experience. Many cases of tuned random generation for a functional perpetual gameplay loop. Implements a simple dialogue system and tutorial system. Implements custom-built, efficient physics system which models real-world in-vacuum velocity/acceleration/gravity. Implements custom hit detection. I took many passes on difficulty tuning, and implements in-code hooks for difficulty settings (In game UI not yet implemented). Comfortable and user-friendly keyboard configuration, inspired by other physics simulation games.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Prototype Postmortem:</h3>
        <p>I spent a lot of time on the visual and audio design for this game, more so than for gameplay itself. I am quite satisfied with the cohesion of all the aesthetic elements, and the responsiveness to player input and feedback, but I feel the gameplay concept itself is rather basic. Since its a fundamentally single-player game, it ends up on the same calibre as simple side-scrollers like the Chrome dino game. Thus I upped the challenge, and made it multidimensional with randomized gravity and a light bit of quick-thinking strategy in regards to the avoidables not being insta-kills but rather being stuns. If I were to further iterate on this to make it more fun, I would add pickups that let you clear plasma around you in a burst by pressing space or something. I would also add more progression based mechanics; rotation levels and bullet-hell patterns. As far as graphics, I was experimenting with particle effects for the thrusters, gravity, and plasma, but they didn't make it into this demo. I also want to improve the feedback with animations such as a Smash Bros-style flair when falling off the screen.</p></li>

    <li><h3>Prototype Closest Other Game:</h3>
        <p>If you cross your eyes, it kind of looks like Flappy Birds...<br>
            Also, the objective being to stay on screen is conceptually like 2D platforming games, or Smash Bros.</p></li>
    <li><h3>High Concept:</h3>
        <p> Play as the remote flight controller for Theta-315, an engineer mech unit dispatched to gather data on an anomalous black hole spawned from the catastrophic meltdown of the fusion core of an advanced orbiting base. Fight fluctuating gravity and avoid dangerous plasma remnants to gather as much data as possible before losing your mech to the black hole.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Theme:</h3><p>
        <b>Tap Dancing</b>: Abstractly, the player <b>taps</b> keys to do little bursts of thruster-fire in order to have his mech dart and <b>dance</b> around obstacles in the face of fluctuating forces. Is that a stretch :P</p></li>
    <li><h3>Mandated Variety:</h3><p>stub</p></li>
    <li><h3>Prototype Goal:</h3><p>Demo the feel and basic ruleset of the game. Demo controls. Test the difficulty and ranges for randomness modulation</p></li>
    <li><h3>Player Experience Goals</h3><p>Self challenge, fast-paced yet tactical with inputs. Skill-based.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>
        Players can fire thrusters to move a mech in zero-G. Gravity can change in any of the cardinal directions, which must be countered by the player who can increase thrust and fire bursts to "hop" in different axises. Player get points for keeping the mech on screen, and loses for letting the mech fall off. Player must avoid plasma projectiles, which shutdown the mech's controls if they hit.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Strategies</h3><p> If players are forced to take a plasma hit, they can create a buffer of velocity against the gravity acceleration before getting shut down, so they slow down during that time. Since plasma comes from the right, it is EXTREMELY dangerous when the gravity is also pulling to the right (cascading effect of plasma damage, usually spells instant game over on hit) Player can increase thrust far higher and use small puffs of fire to manoeuver, so which they are in a pinch, they can go full throttle to fly back.
